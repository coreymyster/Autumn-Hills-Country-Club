# Autumn Hills Country Club
This is the application for the fictional country club "Autumn Hills" designed by Corey Sokol as part of the Software Development Master's Program Capstone. The overall goal of this application is for users to create an account at the Autumn Hills Country Club. Once the account is created, users will then log into their account and then book a tee time in order to play a round of golf at the country club.

The application is hosted through Elastic Beanstalk in AWS, with a MySQL Database set up through Amazon RDS. The cloud based application is accessible here:
